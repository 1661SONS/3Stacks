## 3 Stacks

### Overview

3 Stacks is a barely Outkast-themed Heroku app that performs CRU (create, read, and update) operations of the user's choice, but preferably with Outkast-themed pancake dishes. Users can and add a pancake dish to the SQL database and then devour it, or devour a dish that's already listed on the menu.
