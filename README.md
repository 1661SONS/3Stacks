## 3 Stacks

### Overview

3 Stacks is a barely Outkast-themed Heroku app that performs CRU (create, read, and update) operations of the user's choice, but preferably with Outkast-themed pancake dishes. Users can add a pancake dish to the SQL database menu then immediately devour it, or devour another dish already listed.
